# ShAIkespeare

This is the ShAIkespeare site, it includes a language model to analyze text (such as Shakespeare) and even an AI image generator to help visualize the given text.

## Installation

### 1. Create a Virtual Enviroment (optional)
I would strongly recomend creating a virtual envrioment. If you're curious about the benefits, look them up.

To create one just run `python -m venv venv`. This will create a new folder called ".venv" which will store all the dependencies and keep the project isolated.

### 2. Install Dependencies
Run `pip install requirements.txt` in the command line to install.

### 3. Run Code
Run `python main.py` and go to whatever ip address it is runing at. By default this is [127.0.0.1](127.0.0.1).

## Notes
- It is slow the first time you analyse text.
- The image generator is broken.
